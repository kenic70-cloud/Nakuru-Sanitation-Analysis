# Nakuru-Sanitation-Analysis

# üó∫Ô∏è Geospatial Analysis of Sanitation Infrastructure in Nakuru County, Kenya

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing the distribution, type, and usage of sanitation systems across various Sub-Counties and Wards in Nakuru County, Kenya, utilizing the **WWX_Nakuru-FinishiNK Sanitation Trackbase Vol1a.csv** dataset.

The objective is to leverage geospatial data (`lat` and `long` coordinates) to visualize sanitation coverage and identify disparities in infrastructure development, such as the prevalence of Septic systems versus main Sewer or newer Bio-digesters.

## Key Analysis Areas

The analysis in the accompanying Jupyter Notebook will focus on:

1.  **Spatial Distribution:** Using **Folium** to create an interactive map showing the location and density of various toilet types across Wards (e.g., VIDP, Sewer, Septic, Bio-digester).
2.  **Client Segmentation:** Comparing the sanitation types (`Toilet_Typ`) across different client categories (`School`, `Household`, `Rental Property`).
3.  **Service Adequacy:** Analyzing the ratio of **`No_Users`** to **`System_Doo`** to assess the potential capacity and strain on existing systems.

## Technologies Used

* **Python:** Core programming language.
* **Pandas & NumPy:** Data manipulation and cleaning.
* **Folium / Geopandas:** Geospatial visualization and data processing.
* **Jupyter Notebook:** For presenting the step-by-step analysis.
